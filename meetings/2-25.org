* Contract
- Sanne on holidays, will do next week
- End of March, 4-5 weeks for proposal
* O's W algorithm
- It's a general procedure
  - Stepwise model search + heuristics to discard models
  - We still need to compute marginal likelihoods
  - They derive for directed & undirected graphical models a sequential algorithm
    - Only for chordal graphs (?)
    - Does this work with MRF/linear models?
  - Alternatives (?)
    - Analytical / conjugate normal/inv-gamma
      - Can it be done sequentially?
    - Bridge sampling
      - Not sequentially
* Proposal
- Goals?
- Raftery (1997) implements Occam's window & MC^3 for a linear regression
  - Conjugate priors
  - Already implemented in BMA (R)
- Maybe straight to GGM?
  - The O's W algorithm seems easy to implement
    - ... famous last words
    - Issue is with calcualting the posterior probability
- Overview of Bayesian model selection & model averaging as an improvement over single-model-inference
  - Practically BMA is not nice
  - Occam's window as an alternative
  - Should read fairly simmilar to Kaplan's 2021
** Comparison with alternatives
*** BMA
- Computationally bad
*** MC^3
- I'd assume they don't really mention but I assume they use transdimensional jumps
- Possibly M-H across models and then analytically (?)
*** Frequentist
- We get model uncertainty & specific edges uncertainty
- Computationally more costly than model search based on modification indices + regularization
  - e.g. qgraph/psychonetrics
