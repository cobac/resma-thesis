* Proposal feedback
- Received on Wednesday
  - Idk if you've seen it or not
- Main points:
  - Jonas didn't understood some things
    - And that's the proposal's (my) fault
    - I'll expand a bit more the explanation of Occam's window algorithm, maybe some visuals
- More detail in procedure
- Other ~minor points
- Some contradictory feedback, but that's expected, I'll do what I think it's best
- I'll finish it next week
  - I don't think it's super important for you to prioritize checking it out again, but if you have time
* BMA & BMS from R
* Occam's window
- Implemented.... but error.
- I've bench-marked different implementations of multiple steps
** Caveats
- Everything is quite optimized I think, except:
  - The "choosing to which models to compare part"
    - Requires caching / lookup tables etc
    - For the linear regression I wouldn't expect a big benefit
    - Not gonna prioritize that now
  - Low level stuff like SIMD
  - Parallelization
- Issues with the interface
  - They are working on changing the interface for statistical models, and the old version makes keeping track of the names of the coefficients wonky
  - I've hard-coded a few things, I need to think how to best implement parts of the interface but I need to know how the general interface is going to evolve
- I can still abstract more things, etc, will see how much makes sense once I start implementing other approximations
* Analytical approximation for linear regression
- Which prior recommend?
  - Normal/Normal
  - Normal/Gamma
* Next week
** Proposal response
** Coding
- Testing & CI
- Docs
- Analytical implementation
** On time
- Nice margin
- I had scheduled up to next week just for basic OW, and then the last of april for the analytical
- The first of May is buffer/holidays time too
* Demo/Short simulation?
