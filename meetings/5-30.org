* Analytical marginal linear
- I don't think we are going to use this since BIC seems to work very well
- But I've implemented the Cholesky factorization and it's a x2 speed increase
- I can still do pseudo inverses but meh
* MWE GGM
- I'm using corrected (n-1) covariances for the covariance matrix
  - ... is this correct?
- Issue with target matrix
  - Fitting the model is fine
  - Just a Multivariate normal
  - I'm getting errors when defining the constrained model
  - The resulting precision matrix is not Hermitian
  - Any computational tips?
* Performance
** Linear models
*** From saturated
- With more constrained window,  produces 1/1 results
*** Leaps
- ~Just as BMA
** Intercept wonkyness
- Different packages treat the intercept differently
- So no 100% deterministic reproduction with BMA, but same performance
- Over-selects the intercept even if the true model does not include it
** Upgraded R & Julia
- Something is off
* Next plans
** Refactor
- Right now it is a MWE
- I've realized integrating the GGM model that the current interface is very regression-centric
  - Bit spagguetti getting parameter names and stuff
- It is the perfect time to refactor the Occam's window code
  - I have a clear picture now of all the moving parts I have to manage
- More speed and generality:
  - Store bitvectors and marginals in hash tables
    - Right now what I'm storing is full models
      - A loot of memory allocations
      - For normal usecases it's ok, but for simulations issues
- Drop the marginal approximations interface or maybe keep it and re-calculate the marginals of the remaining models
- Not for perfectionism but for pragmatism
** Implement & test GGM
- Once I figure out the issue with the constrained precision matrix
** Ising
- Likelihood from node-wise estimation?
- Other approaches to get the likelihood for BIC?
** Start simulating
** No laplace/analytical simulations
  - Too long, too many marginal calculations
  - We would need to do some clever sequential calculations with pseudo-likelihoods
- Depends on how it performs with GGM 
* Product expectations
- General, well implemented software
  - ~Easy to access from R
  - Hopefully it works for graphical models (:
- Simulations
- /enough/?
* Summer plans?
- Defense date?
  - ~15th July
- Submission plans?
