* Big refactor
- Big simplification of the code
- Implemented a cache of explored models
- ~x7.5 speed increase
- From a lot (multiple concurrent GB) of memory allocated to 1GB of total memory
- 9% of GC time
- The only thing I can think of to speed up the algorithm is parallelized parts of it
  - Not gonna prioritize, since I'm going to run the simulations in parallel either way
* Occam's with GGM
- Implemented
- Horrible function to go from BitVector to indices of partial correlations
- Precission matrix ends up not being Symmetric, but idk why
  - inv(cov(x))
* Weirdness with linear models hyper
* GGM
** Not counting variances as no. of parameters to calculate the BIC
** Constrained just 0s really?
- Removing edges don't affect the other edges?
- Really??
* Defense
