* Implementation
* Occam's window
*** Found the 2 bugs!
  - One of the conditions for stopping the search...
    - (e.g. in the down pass all candidate models had just 1 parameter)
    - ... was deleting those models and breaking out of the loop without adding the models back in
  - The accepted models and candidate models sets could become the same in some conditions and they would force all models to be deleted
*** Finding the true models
- It was not finding the correct models
- After increasing the sample size to 5,000 it works better
*** Weights of the models
- I thought the weights of the model are suspiciously uniform
- Now I think it's just how BIC works
*** Something fishy about a 0-dim array
** Simple Bayesian Linear Regression with conjugate priors
- WIP as a simple package
- Just linear algebra so not expecting any weird bugs/behavior
* Proposal
* Next week
- Submit proposal revision
- Preliminary simulations and nice demo of BIC + analytical for linear models
