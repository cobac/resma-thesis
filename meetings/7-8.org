* R
- ggm R package is broken with R4.2
- Using psychonetrics
* Glib errors
- Julia ships an outdated version of glibcxx which Rcpp uses
- R packages that depend on Rcpp are broken to use with Julia currently
- I had to use a different julia version that is compiled agains the glibcxx of my distribution instead
  - Instead of their bundled binaries
* Psychonetrics benchmarks
- ML    :: 105ms
- FIML  :: 118ms
- WLS   :: 500ms
- DWLS  :: 500ms
* GGM performance
- Using psychonetrics
- ~40 mins per run with 5k
  - 50 min with 1k
  - whole night was not done at 9000 down-iterations
- 0% gc time
- 130MiB allocated
- as fast as it gets without re-using calculations
  - no time
** Speed
- vs bggm: bggm 1/4 of a sec
- vs bdgraph 1.2 sec
  - With rjmcmc it is 1.5s
  - bdgraph with 5k iterations
** What was the issue with BDgraph?
** I feel like what I've done without optimized marginal calculations is useless
* Simulations
- Single-threaded it'll take me 7 full days
- Get it down to ~3 with parallel
  - If <1h per run
  - Tonight disproved it...
    - Break the run after ~2h running???
- Access to lisa?
