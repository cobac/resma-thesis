* Linear models with implied intercepts
- Took a bit of refactor
- It's the best approach
- Reproducible with BMA?
  - Not really...
  - In terms of results it's simmilar
  - We get most of the times a single model with high probability and a few with very small
  - They report only 1 model (which tends to be the same)
  - I don't think their code follows the algorithm as described in the papers
    - But idk it's hard to understand their code
  - So I don't think we are computationally reproducible... but it is what it is
  - At this point I'd be very surprises if there is a bug in my implementation

* Tests
- I had fell quite behind... and I couldn't refactor without them

* Relatively Big refactor
- Before before I re-calculated each marginal likelihoods for every comparison
- Last refactor I implemented a cache so we fitted each model once
- Not we don't fit models, just calculate marginals directly
  - Saves allocations of the model objects
  - It was an issue for GGMs, as I had to invert a matrix per model fitted
  - Not implemented for linear models, but should be trivial and not-necessary

* GGM
- Reverted back to just putting 0s in the precision matrix
  - Unnecessary allocations with the psychometric specification
    - And I don't think those are the ML estimates
  - But the matrices are not posdef
    - (I don't think they were either before but I wasn't checking)
    - First eigen value can end-up being 0
      - Julia dispatch weird because the cholesky implementation calls LAPACK
      - Thought it was floating point errors
- Went back a different specification of the ggm but instead of saches to Padmanabhan, N., & O'Connell, R. (2016) http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stw1042
  - With Sacha's I have to invert a matrix each time
  - But again, that's specification not estimation
- A lot of literature on multiple algorithms to estimate the ML
  - The sample cov-mat doesn't seem to be the MLE for the saturated????
    - I don't think this is true
  - ggm R package uses two algorithms
    - Not trivial to implement
  - sacha/psychometrics not in the papers and I don't follow their source code
- So... I'm just gonna use ggm or psychonetrics from R to get the ML estimates
  - Meh but

* Simulations
- Williams & Sacha papers use the same simulation conditions
- Williams runs BDgraph too
- If their supplementary materials are good (issues with login) I won't have to run those sims
- Everything ready to run
  - Less than 1 day

* State of the thesis
- 3 weeks
- Writing... not prioritized
  - In the thesis I'm not gonna write all of the detours and details of the scenic route
  - Very straightforward
- I've checked that everything is ready to run simulations
- Schedule defense on the 22nd
  - email of the secretariaat by any chance?
    - Other departmends have on the website but not the methods
- Submission, whenever it's done, hopefully a bit earlier than defense so it's easy to grade before Aug
- If not, I don't need the title too fast
