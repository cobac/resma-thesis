* Proposal
- I'm happy
- I predict either approval or asking for more details about the procedure
* Another BF approximation
- Frantisek & EJ's paper with an approximation of the BF based on the MLE and it's standard error
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.01435.pdf
- Very easy to implement
- Although (I'm not sure) I think only works if the two models only differ in one single parameter
  - Maybe it's extensible if the difference is a set of parameters (?)
  - Most of the comparisons during model search are between models that only differ on 1 parameter
  - .. But not all of them
* Implementation
- Use and wrap existing Julia libraries and interface
- There are amazing interfaces for frequentist, ML-y and Bayesian-sampled models
  - Not for Bayes not based on sampling
  - ... I'm not gonna do it and it's not necessary
  - But still, we can re-use and hook into a lot of the already established interfaces
- Now I'm using the frequentist interface for the BIC approximation
  - Need to generalize & extend it a bit once we need to store priors and compute the likelihoodÂ·prior product
  - It's fine I think I know the best interface to do it
** Interface
- The implementation with would work as long as someone defines
  1. How to get which parameters are included in a model struct
  2. How to calculate the marginal for that model & approximation
- With default fallbacks
  - BIC, CAS,
  - ~2 liners
** Progress
- BMA implemented
- Interface for Occam's window model search implemented
  - Design and all data structures ready
- Model sets logic (i.e. model representation as =BitVector= and checking if two models are sub-models)

* Next week
- Implement model search
  - All pre-requisites ready
- Hopefully analytical marginals for linear regression too
- On schedule, allotted 3 weeks to get model search working with BIC for linear models + 1 for the analytical

* Handbook variable selection book
