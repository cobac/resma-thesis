This repository contains all the code and document files from my [[https://github.com/cobac/resma-thesis/blob/main/products/thesis/thesis.pdf][Master's thesis]]. It is possible to audit the development of this project through the git history of this repository (e.g. meeting minutes, old code).

All of our results and code are available in this repository.

The repository is structured in the following way:

- =products/= :: Contains the research proposal and the thesis document, as well as feedback for different versions of both documents.
- =sims/= :: Contains the analysis scripts and results. To access our results unarchive the =output.tar.gz= archive into the =output= folder
	- All code is written in the Julia programming language. To run a script /instantiate/ the =Manifest.toml= of the corresponding folder to guarantee that the correct versions of all dependencies are used (do not update the packages!). More info about reproducing Julia projects at https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/#Using-someone-else's-project .
- =packages/= :: Contains the code from our Occam's window implementation, as well as some helper packages to deal with Gaussian graphical models and analytical calculations of the marginal likelihoods of linear regression models.

All of our results can be replicated by ensuring that Julia (>1.6) is installed and running the =Makefile= from the =sims= folder. It is also possible to partially run the simulations or to only run the analysis script.
